# **End to End Machine Learning Projects**
This repository showcases a collection of end-to-end machine learning projects that demonstrate the full lifecycle of ML development. From initial data analysis to model deployment, each project encapsulates the critical stages of building and deploying machine learning models.

## Project structure overview:
1. Introduction 
2. Problem Statement
3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data Transformation
6. Model Building & Training
7. Evaluation Metrics
8. Prediction
9. Implementation
10. Model Deployment

## Tools
- Python
- Python Libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...)
- FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit
- Docker
- MLflow

## Create an enviroment, setup and structure:
1. Enviroment: conda create -n venv python=3.10 -y
2. Setup and requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Template: python template.py
