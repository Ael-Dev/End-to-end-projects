## Exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps reference:
1. Initial Dataset Review:
- Comprehension: Understand the dataset’s features, size, and structure.
- Documentation: Note initial observations for deeper analysis.
- Descriptive Statistical Analysis:
- Central Tendency: Calculate mean, median, and mode.
- Dispersion: Assess variability with standard deviation, variance, and range.
2. Data Visualization Techniques:
- Distribution: Visualize data distributions with histograms and density plots.
3. Feature Analysis:
- Outliers: Detect outliers using statistical tests or visual methods.
- Missing Values: Analyze the pattern of missingness in the data.
- Duplicated Values
4. Analysis of Data Distribution:
- Skewness and Kurtosis: Measure asymmetry and tail density.
- Target Variable Analysis: Examine the distribution for biases or anomalies.
5. Bivariate Analysis:
- Relationships: Explore potential relationships with scatter plots and pair plots.
- Group Comparisons: Compare different groups with box plots and violin plots.
6. Feature Analysis:
- Correlation with Target: Examine how each feature relates to the target variable.
7. Multivariate Analysis:
- Correlation Matrix and Heatmaps
- Feature Interactions: Identify relationships between features.


## End to end machine learning life cycle reference:
1. Choose a Dataset: Identify a dataset that aligns with your project goals, whether it’s self-collected or sourced from platforms like Kaggle or UCI ML Repository.
2. Data Ingestion: Load the chosen dataset into your machine learning environment for initial exploration and analysis.
3. Preprocess the Data: Clean and prepare your data by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like One Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
4. Data Transformation: Perform necessary transformations such as normalization, scaling, and feature engineering to make the data suitable for model training.
5. Model Training: Select and train machine learning models using the transformed dataset.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics to ensure they meet the desired criteria.
7. Model Implementation: Integrate the model into the existing production environment to interact with the current systems and processes.
8. Model Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
9. Model Deployment: Deploy the model into a production environment where it can provide predictions as a service.
10. CI/CD Pipelines: Establish Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions to automate and streamline the deployment process.
11. Cloud Deployment: Deploy the model to cloud services such as AWS to ensure scalability and accessibility.
